# Challenges

### Challenge One: Standard Libraries
Using node's standard libraries `http` and `fs` and built-in JSON support, read in a comma-seprated file of key-value pairs, and create an HTTP server which returns the file's contents as JSON.

### Challenge Two: CommonJS Modules
Create two new CommonJS modules in a project directory.  One module should expose an instantiable object called "Person". Your constructor should accept a JavaScript object literal, which will have properties to assign to the Person. Every person should have a property `knowsKungFu` set to `false`.  The constructor should be able to override this. To accomplish this, install `underscore` from npm and use it's `_.extend` function in your constructor.

Your second custom module will be a custom logger, which will have an `info` logging function.  This function should print out the current date and time, as well as the given log message.

### Challenge Three: Express and Request Routing
Create an Express application which responds to an HTTP `GET` request, and renders an HTML page using the EJS template engine. This HTML page should contain a form, which issues a `POST` action to log in a user, then redirect back to the same page.

The `POST` action should store the user's username somehow - either in memory (store in an object) or in a cookie.  On every `GET` request to the form, the app should check for a logged-in user using connect middleware.  If the username has been stored, it should be displayed in the HTML page using a context variable for the EJS template engine.
