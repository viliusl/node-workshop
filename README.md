This is all the material for the NodeJS Workshop.

# Setup Instructions
1. Install Node v8 (currently v8.1.4)
2. Install git
3. `$ git clone git@github.com:viliusl/node-workshop.git`
4. `$ cd node-workshop`
5. `$ npm install` (this takes a while)
   * Note for Windows users: the `npm install` may show errors related to python or C++. 
     Feel free to ignore them.
6. To test your setup, run `$ npm test`. This will test all the code
   that is used in the workshop, including the solved exercises

## Setup Visual Studio Code (optional, but recommended)
If you prefer another IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse/WebStore), 
or just want to use Notepad/Vim/Emacs, feel free to do so. But
if you don't know which one you want, 
then we would recommend Visual Studio Code.

# What's In This Repository?
This repository has 3 parts:
* [Tutorial](01-tutorial-code/README.md): this includes fully functioning
  (and tested!) programs that demonstrate all the things we learn about. This is 
  _exactly_ the code that will be shown by the instructor in the first half
  of the workshop.
* [Exercises](02-exercises/README.md): this is the part where you get to write
  code. See below for more information on the exercises.
